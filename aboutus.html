	   <p>The idea of dinosaur saddles first came about in August of 1872 in the wild, wild west when three brothers: Cody Lalone, Brandon Martin, and Connor Wilkinson were tired of riding their dinosaurs bareback. They were tired of herding cattle in the extreme heat on such unconfortable animals. The Stegosaurus was especially unconfortable. As a result, dinosaur saddles became a thing. The first prototype came about in October of 1872. It was a mixture of cotton, bison hide, and pine. For over a century, our customers have supported us through thick and thin and brought us into what we are today.
Currently our saddles consist of luxerious materials which only add to the experience of dinosaur riding. Our saddles consist of 100% pure Asian rhino hide, a saddlehorn made from pure ivory derived from elephant tusks and American bald eagle feather accents. These come with optional dying the die of which comes from tree frogs. (all natural)
