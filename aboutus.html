	   <p>The idea of dinosaur saddles first came about in August of 1872 in the wild, wild west when three brothers: Cody Lalone, Brandon Martin, and Connor Wilkinson were tired of riding their dinosaurs bareback. They were tired of herding cattle in the extreme heat on such unconfortable animals, especially the Stegosaurus. As a result, dinosaur saddles became a thing.(Add more of sob story and add information about the company's history.) </p>
